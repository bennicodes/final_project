## Usage

Open the index.html file in your browser.
Navigate through the page by clicking the buttons on the cards or using the navbar links. To go back to landing page, you can press the Apple logo.

Cart Items can be added by pressing buy on the product cards. To remove one item press the minus button in the cart until zero and the product will disappear. To add a more of the same item press the plus button or buy button on the same product. To clear the whole cart press the trash icon in the cart.

Press on the product cards to display information about the product in a popup window. You can also add the product to the cart through the popup window. To close the popup window, press outside the popup or the x button in the top right corner.

The filter buttons can be toggled multiple buttons at the same time if wanted.

I used this video to help with the card but fixed the local storage differently:

I used some chat GPT because I had trouble with being able to have multiple filters active at the sa time.
I also used some chat to implement the correct product into the popup window.
But all the code is written or configured by me, in attempts to make the code simpler or more efficient and maintainable.
